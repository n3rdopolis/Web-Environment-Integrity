Steps:
1. Don't do this
2. Delete this repository
3. We are too big. It's time to ask the FTC to smash us up into a bunch of tiny little pieces. Like Standard Oil. Holy shit we made a LOT of money. How much more do we actually need. Maybe we don't need to jump out a window when our profits don't go up every single day!
